    <h1>Shadow on the Earth</h1>

    <div class="div1">
        <p>
            Out beyond the sitting room, which the rays of the sun can at best but barely reach, we extend the eaves or build on a veranda, putting the sunlight at still greater a remove. The light from the garden steals in but dimly through paper-paneled doors, and it is precisely this indirect light that makes for us the <a href="decoration.html">charm of a room</a>.  
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="div2">
        <p>
            We do our <a href="e1.html">walls in neutral colors</a> so that the sad, fragile, dying rays can sink into absolute repose. The storehouse, kitchen, hallways, and such may have a glossy finish, but the walls of the sitting room will almost always be of day textured with fine sand. A luster here would destroy the soft fragile beauty of the feeble light.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="div3">
        <p>
            We delight in the mere sight of the <a href="e2.html">delicate glow</a> of fading rays clinging to the surface of a dusky wall, there to live out what little life remains to them. We never tire of the sight, for to us this pale glow and these dim shadows far surpass any ornament.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="div4">
        <p>
            And so, as we must if we are not to disturb the glow, we finish the walls with sand in a single neutral color. The hue may differ from room to room, but the degree of difference will be ever so slight; not so much a difference in color as in shade, a difference that will seem to exist only in the mood of the viewer.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="div5">
        <p>
            And from these delicate differences in the <a href="e3.html">hue of the walls</a>, the shadows in each room take on a tinge peculiarly their own.

        </p>
